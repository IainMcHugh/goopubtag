# Goopubtag

Goopubtag is a modern solution for [Google Publisher tag](https://developers.google.com/publisher-tag/guides/get-started) in React applications. It was heavily inspired by the widely used [react-dfp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dfp) package, and aims to provide a similar DX but with some improvements:

- Functional approach (with hooks) 🪝
- Type safety with typescript 🎉
- Ease of use with debug mode 🛠️
- Support for most recent GPT implementations 🚀

To get started, head over to the [documentation site](https://www.goopubtag.com).
